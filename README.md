# Multi agent reinforcement learning for search and rescue bots

Create a virtual environment and install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run the application using `python main.py {file_name}` where `file_name` is the name of the file where you want to save the current map.

A blank map will open up where you can create the kind of environment you want to simulate.
Draw around with the mouse to check how it looks. Press `t` on the keyboard and then click on the areas where you want to put targets.
Once done, press `esc` and the simulation will begin.
